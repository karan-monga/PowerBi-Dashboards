# 📊 Power BI Dashboards

This is my collection of Power BI dashboards - all the fun (and functional) data projects I’ve built using Power BI — from job market deep dives to business performance reports.

Most of these were built using real-world datasets, cleaned up and shaped into something actually useful.

## 🛠️ What I Used & Learned

Each dashboard in here is a mini case study in:

🧹 **Power Query (ETL):** Cleaning up messy data and getting it dashboard-ready  
📐 **DAX & Measures:** Custom metrics like salary medians, remote job ratios, etc.  
📊 **Visuals:** Bar charts, line charts, KPIs, maps — you name it  
🕹️ **Interactivity:** Slicers, drill-throughs, bookmarks, buttons — so users don’t just stare, they explore  
🎨 **Design thinking:** Making sure the layout isn’t just pretty, but tells a story
