# 📊 Power BI Dashboards

my collection of Power BI dashboards!  
This is my collection of Power BI dashboards - all the fun (and functional) data projects I’ve built using Power BI — from job market deep dives to business performance reports.

Most of these were built using real-world datasets, cleaned up and shaped into something actually useful.

## 🛠️ What I Used & Learned

Each dashboard in here is a mini case study in:

- **Power Query (ETL)**: Cleaning up messy data and getting it dashboard-ready
- **DAX & Measures**: Custom metrics like salary medians, remote job ratios, etc.
- **Visuals**: Bar charts, line charts, KPIs, maps — you name it
- **Interactivity**: Slicers, drill-throughs, bookmarks, buttons — so users don’t just stare, they explore
- **Design thinking**: Making sure the layout isn’t just pretty, but tells a story

### [`data-jobs-dashboard`](./data-jobs-dashboard)
Curious what the data job market looks like in 2024? This dashboard breaks down job titles, salaries, remote work stats, and even shows where the hiring is happening — globally.

### [`sales-performance`](./sales-performance)
Classic sales dashboard. Revenue trends, profit margins, and a breakdown by region and product. Basically, what every manager asks for on Monday morning.

### [`customer-churn`](./customer-churn)
Trying to figure out why people leave? This one explores churn based on customer behavior, location, and more — useful for retention or just general curiosity.

## 🤔 Why Power BI?

Because Excel deserves a break sometimes.  
Power BI lets me build reports that are actually fun to interact with — clean visuals, fast insights, and smooth user experiences. These dashboards show how I think through data, design, and storytelling — all in one place.
